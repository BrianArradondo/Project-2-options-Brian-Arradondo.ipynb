### The Business Problems to be answered: 
#### What are the main contributors to incomes above a certain fixed range? 
#### Are they what we would think they are? 
#### Are the results of these Analytical models intuitive or counterintuitive? 
#### What could this information be used for?

### The Stakeholders: 
#### Those who work in Government Programs, Non - Profits or Start-ups and want to get a sense of whether contributing effort to or removing effort from different programs could produce a positive result in the category of improving incomes for struggling demographics. This is about establishing a starting point of the application of highly focused efforts for the highest return on your efforts.

## Adult Income DataSet

1. Kaggle was the Source of data

2. Brief description of data - The data analyzes the shared data points while showing the disparity in the large sample size of those who have incomes above and below the target value.

3. Income (above 50k) is the target.

4. What does one row represent? One row represents education, a workclass, native continent or another relevant data point.

5. Is this a classification or regression problem? This is a classification problem.

6. How many features does the data have? This has 488842 entries and 14 rows.

7. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset? There were no significant  challenges in this dataset.

## Education Visual

 - There appears to be a strong correlation between race and higher levels of education. This shows a disparity of an educational advantage favoring some race distinctions. This is an interesting trend to take note of.
 
 ## WorkClass Visual

- This visual shows that overwhelmingly, the workclass in the Private category makes up the majority. This would seem to imply that the best probability for incomes that exceed the 50K annual range exist in the realm of private work.

My Model shows with a strong level of Precision as a Metric, its ability to intepret the key factors that predict incomes above the 50K range. This is further reflected in the scores provided.

# Recommendations for Stakeholders
## Based on my Analytical findings: If one wants to pursue paths to promote incomes that reach and or exceed the 50K level then they want to focus on areas related to education and then consider placement in a private work class category. The combination of these two factors seem to correlate to producing paths to incomes that reach or exceed the 50K range.
